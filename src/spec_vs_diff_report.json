  "summary": "The diff successfully implements REQ-17 by replacing the Header component logo with an LG Electronics logo image asset. The implementation uses an <img> tag pointing to '/assets/generated/lg-logo.dim_400x150.png', maintains the existing header layout structure with the wrench icon and 'Life's Good' tagline, and applies appropriate sizing (h-10 w-auto). All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the evidence provided.",
