## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the current logo with the official LG logo and apply comprehensive LG brand theme across the entire service center page.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace SVG-based logo in Header component with official LG Electronics logo image
- Apply LG Heritage Red (#A50034) accent color consistently across all page sections
- Update typography to follow LG brand guidelines with clean, modern sans-serif styling
- Redesign component styling (cards, buttons, forms, accordions) to reflect LG brand aesthetics
- Update background colors, border treatments, and card designs using subtle grays and whites with LG red accents
- Ensure all icons, badges, and graphical elements complement the LG brand aesthetic

**User-visible outcome:** The service center page displays the official LG logo in the header and features a comprehensive LG brand theme with consistent red accents, professional typography, and cohesive visual design across all sections including hero, appliance categories, service features, forms, FAQ, and contact information.
